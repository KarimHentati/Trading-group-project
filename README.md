Banks: Attijari and UIB were chosen for their balanced approach to liquidity, solvency, and profitability.
4. Portfolio Optimization
Optimization Approach: Initially, a minimization of variance approach was used targeting a 15% return. Due to budget constraints, the portfolio was reoptimized using the maximization of the Sharpe ratio to improve the risk-return profile.
5. Technical Analysis
Stock Performances: Selected stocks like MGR, SFBT, and UIB showed significant returns, while others like SOTRAPIL and SOTIPAPIER experienced smaller or negative returns, particularly after including fees.
6. Portfolio Performance
Initial Return (Dec 15 - 22, 2023): A decline of -2.81%.
Adjusted Return (Dec 22 - 29, 2023): A positive return of 2.09%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the portfolio's reoptimization.
Market Comparison: The portfolio's performance was initially below the market, but by December 27-29, it surpassed the broader market, driven by key holdings like TJARI and MGR.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of a comprehensive approach to portfolio management, including detailed financial analysis, macroeconomic insights, and strategic stock selection. The portfolio’s reoptimization strategy highlighted the effectiveness of using risk-adjusted return measures like the Sharpe ratio to adapt to real-world constraints.
